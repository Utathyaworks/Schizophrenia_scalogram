# Schizophrenia Detection from Electroencephalogram Signals Using Image Encoding and Wrapper-based Deep Feature Selection Approach
## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a novel three-stage deep learning-based framework for detecting schizophrenia from EEG signals. The proposed method leverages image encoding, transfer learning, and a newly developed Average Subtraction Wrapper-based Feature Selection method to improve classification accuracy and reduce computational overhead.

## 🧠 About Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that affects perception, cognition, emotions, and behavior, impacting approximately 1% of the global population. EEG (Electroencephalogram) signals offer a non-invasive and high-temporal-resolution way to detect subtle abnormalities in brain activity, which is valuable for early and accurate schizophrenia detection.

## 🚀 Proposed Framework
The framework comprises the following three main stages:

### Image Encoding of EEG Signals
Raw EEG time-series signals are converted into scalogram images using Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) to retain both spatial and temporal characteristics of the data.

### Feature Extraction using Transfer Learning
Two pre-trained deep learning models (EfficientNetB3 and DenseNet169) are applied to extract deep features from the encoded images.

### Average Subtraction Wrapper-based Feature Selection
A novel feature selection method is introduced to eliminate redundant and non-informative features, improving model performance and generalization.
